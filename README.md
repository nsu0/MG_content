Here is another repository to contain all kind of crap needed for MonkeyGun. Ignore this please and go to the real site.

## Flash player:
Is ```FlashPlayer.html```, it has the **ruffle** player script to run flash games after it's nostalgic death, (**thank you ruffle**) and another script to run the flash .swf hosted by a link.
**Example:** ```https://nsu0.github.io/MG_content/FlashPlayer.html?swf=https://example.com/example.swf```, just add at the end the swf file link and it will run it. There may be some problems with the ruffle player so it's reccomended to you to test the player before using it. I don't reccomend you to using it because I made it just for my personal use...
